# Remapper

Remapper is a web application that can generate an interactive map of paths traveled by foot or by bike, with embedded images and text descriptions that help record great moments of a trip.

## How does it work?

Remapper is a Python [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) app. To start up the Remapper server, run `__init__.py` inside the `remapper` directory. Once the server starts up, Remapper can be accessed by navigating to `127.0.0.1:5000` in a web browser on the local device or by navigating to `[host computer IPv4]:5000` on another device (for example `192.168.1.48:5000`).
